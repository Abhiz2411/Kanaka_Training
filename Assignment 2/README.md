## Assignment 2 - Time Class

The "Assignment 2" folder contains the code and related files for our second assignment, which is the "Time Class" program. In this assignment, we created a Java class called "Time" to represent time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The program allows users to set and retrieve time, as well as add two time objects together, handling carryover values correctly.

### Features

- **Set and Retrieve Time**: Users can set and retrieve time values (hours, minutes, and seconds) using the "Time" class.

- **Add Time**: The program can add two time objects together and display the result, taking into account any carryover values.

### Usage

To use the "Time Class" program:

1. Run the `Demo1` class to start the program.

2. Follow the prompts to enter time values for two instances (`t1` and `t2`).

3. The program will display the initial time values and the result of adding the two times together.

### Example

Let's walk through an example of how to use the "Time Class" program:

1. Start the program by running the `Demo1` class.

2. When prompted, you'll be asked to enter time values for two instances (`t1` and `t2`). Follow the prompts to enter time values for each instance:

#### Enter t1 hour:
- For this example, let's enter `4`.

#### Enter t1 minutes:
- Enter `30`.

#### Enter t1 seconds:
- Enter `15`.

#### Enter t2 hour:
- Let's enter `2`.

#### Enter t2 minutes:
- Enter `45`.

#### Enter t2 seconds:
- Enter `50`.

3. After entering the time values for both instances, the program will display the initial time values:

`T1 time : 4:30:15`<br>
`T2 time : 2:45:50`

4. The program will then calculate t

he sum of the two time instances and display the result, handling carryover values correctly:

`------ Added time: Day 1: 7:16:5 ------`


This demonstrates how to use the "Time Class" program to set and add time values, as well as display the results. You can enter different time values to perform various time calculations.
