# Book Management System

This Java project is a simple Book Management System that allows users to input information about books, such as author name, total pages, price, and date of purchase.

## Problem Statement

You are tasked with developing a program that can store and manage information about books. Users should be able to input details for multiple books, including the author's name, the total number of pages, the price, and the date of purchase. The program should then display this information for each book entered.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we have created a Java program with two main classes:

1. `Book`: This class represents a book object and contains attributes for the author's name, total pages, price, and date of purchase. It also provides getter and setter methods for these attributes.

2. `Demo`: This class contains the main method where the user interacts with the program. It uses a Scanner object to take input from the user for the number of books and details of each book. It then creates an array of Book objects to store this information and displays it back to the user.

### Usage

1. Run the `Demo` class to start the program.

2. Enter the number of books you want to input.

3. For each book, enter the following details:
   - Author's name
   - Total number of pages
   - Price
   - Date of purchase (Year, Month, Day)

4. The program will display the information you entered for each book.

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the program:
