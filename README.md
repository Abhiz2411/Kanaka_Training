# Kanaka Company Training Repository

Welcome to the Kanaka Company Training Repository! This repository contains code and assignments completed during our training phase. Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific assignment or problem-solving session.

## Assignment 1 - Book Management System

The "Assignment 1" folder contains the code and related files for our first assignment. In this assignment, we implemented a simple Book Management System in Java. The program allows users to input information about books, including author name, total pages, price, and date of purchase. It provides a basic user interface for entering and displaying book details.

### Usage

To run the "Assignment 1" program, follow the instructions provided in the README.md file inside the folder.

## Assignment 2 - Time Class

The "Assignment 2" folder contains the code and related files for our second assignment. In this assignment, we created a Java class called "Time" to represent time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The program allows users to set and retrieve time, as well as add two time objects together, handling carryover values correctly.

### Usage

To run the "Assignment 2" program, follow the instructions provided in the README.md file inside the folder.
