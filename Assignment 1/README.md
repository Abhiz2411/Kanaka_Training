## Assignment 1 - Book Management System

The "Assignment 1" folder contains the code and related files for our first assignment, which is the "Book Management System" program. In this assignment, we developed a Java program to manage information about books. Here's an overview of the features and usage:

### Features

- **Input Book Information**: Users can enter details for multiple books, including the author's name, total number of pages, price, and date of purchase.

- **Data Validation**: The program ensures data integrity by validating inputs, such as checking for valid numeric values and date formatting.

- **Display Book Information**: It displays the information entered for each book, including author, price, total pages, and date of purchase.

### Usage

To use the "Book Management System" program:

1. Run the `Demo` class to start the program.

2. Enter the number of books you want to input.

3. For each book, follow these steps:
   - Enter the author's name.
   - Enter the total number of pages in the book.
   - Enter the price of the book.
