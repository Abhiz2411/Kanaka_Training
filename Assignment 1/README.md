Welcome to the Kanaka Company Training Repository! This repository contains code and assignments completed during our training phase. Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific assignment or problem-solving session.

## Assignment 1 - Book Management System

The "Assignment 1" folder contains the code and related files for our first assignment, which is the "Book Management System" program. In this assignment, we developed a Java program to manage information about books. Here's an overview of the features and usage:

### Features

- **Input Book Information**: Users can enter details for multiple books, including the author's name, total number of pages, price, and date of purchase.

- **Data Validation**: The program ensures data integrity by validating inputs, such as checking for valid numeric values and date formatting.

- **Display Book Information**: It displays the information entered for each book, including author, price, total pages, and date of purchase.

### Usage

To use the "Book Management System" program:

1. Run the `Demo` class to start the program.

2. Enter the number of books you want to input.

3. For each book, follow these steps:
   - Enter the author's name.
   - Enter the total number of pages in the book.
   - Enter the price of the book.
   - Enter the date of purchase (Year, Month, Day).

4. The program will display the information you entered for each book.

### Example

Let's walk through an example of how to use the "Book Management System" program:

1. Start the program by running the `Demo` class.

2. When prompted, enter the number of books you want to input. For this example, we'll enter `2`.


3. Now, you'll be prompted to enter information for each book. Follow the prompts to enter details for each book:
